    "Many machine learning (ML) problems and methods consist of three components: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data points as the basic (atomic) unit of information. Data points are characterized by features, which are  properties that can be measured (or computed) easily. Besides features, data points are often associated with certain labels that represent some higher-level information or quantity of interest. In contrast to features, labels are difficult to acquire and much of machine learning is about to develop methods that allow to estimate or predict the labels of a data point based on its features.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. A hypothesis space (also referred to as a ML model) consisting of computationally feasible predictor functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A loss function that is used to assess the quality of a particular predictor function. "

    "To implement ML methods, we need to be able to efficiently **store and manipulate** data and predictor functions.  A quite powerful tool to represent and manipulate data and predictor functions are [matrices and vectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_(mathematics)). \n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, data points can often be characterized by a list of numeric attributes, or \"features\", $x_{r}$ which can be stacked conveniently into a vector $\\mathbf{x}=\\big(x_{1},\\ldots,x_{n}\\big)^{T}$. Moreover, many ML methods (such as linear regression or logistic regression) use predictor functions of the form $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$ with some weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$. Note that once we restrict ourselves to linear functions of the form $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$, we can represent a predictor function by the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$. Indeed, given the weight vector $\\mathbf{w}$, we can evaluate the predictor function for any feature vector $\\mathbf{x}$ as $h(\\mathbf{x}) = \\mathbf{w}^{T} \\mathbf{x}$. "

    "### Learning the Best Predictor by Fitting a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "A key idea underlying ML is to choose predictor functions $h(x)$ based on how well they fit historic or training data. For linear predictors, of the form $h(x)=w \\cdot x$, the search of a good predictor reduces to the search for a good choice for the weight $w \\in \\mathbb{R}$ which is just a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "To search for a good predictor function $h$, which maps a feature value $x$ to the predicted label $\\hat{y}=h(x)$, we need to measure the loss (or error) incurred when the true label is $y$ but the predicted label is $\\hat{y}$. There are many different choices for how to define such a loss fucntion. In general, we are free to define the loss function to best suit the application at hand. However, for certain classes of machine learning problems some useful choices for the loss functions have crystalized. For example, if the labels of data points take on numeric values, a widely used choice for the loss function is the squared error loss $(y - \\hat{y})^{2}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using loss functions to measure the quality of a predictor requires the availability of data points for which we know the true label $y$. One option to get labeled data is from historic recordings or experiments. Assume we have some labeled data points $(x^{(1)},y^{(1)}),\\ldots,(x^{(m)},y^{(m)})$ consisting of $m$ data points. The $i$th data point has the feature $x^{(i)}$ and the true label $y^{(i)}$. \n",
